Todos:
    - AST Sim clone state function
    - locations of runner (need to be at root of ast folder)
    - location of data folder with dsrnn model (needs relative path from ast batch runner)
      temporarily copied data folder to ast folder

    - add to python path for runner to find crowd sim packages:
      export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/peterdu2/policy_summarization/AST_CrowdNav


MCTS Iteration info:
DPWParams:
  d = max search depth (ie max_path_length)
  gamma = discount factor
  ec = exporation bonus
  k = The constraint parameter used in DPW: |N(s,a)|<=kN(s)^alpha.
  alpha = The constraint parameter used in DPW: |N(s,a)|<=kN(s)^alpha.

  n = maximum number of iterations
    = 2 * max(n_itr * log_interval // max_path_length ** 2, 1)
  n_iter, log_interval, and max_path_length provided by algo args in runner.py
