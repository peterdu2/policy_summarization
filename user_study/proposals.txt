Position sets:
	Position set 1:
		dsrnn1	['14000.pt', '20600.pt']
  		dsrnn3  ['20600.pt', '30800.pt']
  		dsrnn5  ['14000.pt', '30800.pt']

  	Position set 4:
 		dsrnn12	['14000.pt', '20600.pt']
  		dsrnn13	['20600.pt', '30800.pt']
  		dsrnn14	['14000.pt', '30800.pt']

- Divide each position set into 3 policies
	- Each policy: 6 trajectory examples (top 3 from each AST tree)
	- 3 x 6 = 18 examples per position set
	- Match with random sample trajectory examples
		- 6 samples for each policy 

User study groupings:
	- 3 position sets (PS1, PS4, PS5->tbd)
	- 18 AST examples per position set
		- 6 per policy
	- 18 random examples per position set
		- 6 per policy 

How to split users:
	1) Split per position set
		- Each user gets 1 position set
		- Shown random set -> asked to rank policies
		- Shown AST set -> asked to rank policies
		- Total = 36 trajectories 
	2) Split per random/AST
		- Each user shown all 3 position sets for either AST or random
		- Total = 18 x 3 = 44 trajectories 
		- Split into stages (PS1, PS2, PS3) -> ask for ranking at end
		- May be too many examples 
	3) Split per random/AST
		- Show each user one position set
		- n users per position set
		- need 3n users for AST, 3n users for random

Data collection:
	- policy ranking (absolute ordering)
	- Need some sort of scale for confidence/ranking of separation of policies
	Candidates:
		- Semantic differential questions:
			The difference between the lowest ranked policy and middle ranked policy is:
			very low ........................................... very high

			The difference between the middle ranked policy and highest ranked policy is:
			very low ........................................... very high

		- Likart scale questions:
			It was easy to distinguish between the lowest ranked policy and the middle ranked policy:
			strongly disagree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree, agree, strongly agree

			It was easy to distinguish between the middle ranked policy and the highest ranked policy:
			strongly disagree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree, agree, strongly agree
